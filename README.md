# CropJob
This is a online market place for farmers for assured contract farming, this idea is based on Smart India Hackathon Problem Statemen-SIH1640 


We are making a website named ‘CropJob’ and here we are going to make an online marketplace where there will be registered buyers and farmers with direct connections where buyers can choose from which farmer they are going to buy which crop and what amount and farmers will decide what will be the price. Here buyers can compare the price, quality, and farmer reviews by previous buyers. Here we will make a payment system where the buyers have to pay the investment cost to the farmer and an online signed agreement will be done between the two of them and a deadline will be set by both parties by mutual discussion. An online reporting system will be available if a farmer or buyer misbehaves in the marketplace. Contacts will be given to both parties after the agreement and an online chat box will be there for pre-agreement discussions. There will be a fine for late payment for the buyers if the payment deadline crosses, the buyer has to pay a 5% fine on the agreed payment for each day also if the farmer crosses the deadline for the delivery of crops they will get 5% less payment from the agreed payment for each day. For accidental or weather-related issues the farmer's late delivery will be considered and as per the conditions. If for some unfortunate reasons the farmer failed to deliver the crop then as per the condition the loss will be divided between both the parties.
It will solve the uncertainties of the market for farmers. No more taking risks and assuming the amount they can sell. Here they can get assured payment of the exact amount of crops they produce. They don’t have to face the off-season issue for crops they can get payment as they want from the buyers for off-season crops. They don’t have to borrow from anyone as they get the initial investment costs from the buyers at the time of agreement. Farmers can set deadlines for the buyers for payment so they don’t have to face late payment issues. For the buyers, they can choose the farmers by reading reviews and checking quality and price. They can set deadlines for the farmers for crop delivery.
